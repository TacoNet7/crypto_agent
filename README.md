# crypto_agent
crypto_agent is a modular Python bot that trades cryptocurrencies automatically using data-driven technical indicators, dynamic risk management, and configurable timeframes. It’s designed to be safe by default — backtesting and paper-trading come first, with risk controls baked in for live execution later.
